## About The Project

This project is built for a real client that has just started a small publishing company in Sydney. Design, functionality and assets have all been provided by the client. This is built using React. Currently there is no backend or user authentication, but I am in the process of building this using Express, Node JS and Mongo DB. User passwords will be hashed with Bcrypt and user authentication/authorisation will be handled using JWT.

## Built With

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. React

## Usage

Demo website is currently live at - [https://useful-publishing.netlify.app/]

## Roadmap

Phase 1 - Frontend (no backend)
Phase 2 - Fullstack project with admin panel
Phase 3 - Add authentication and protected routes
Phase 4 - Add cart and payments
