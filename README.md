Useful Publishing

Phase 1 - Frontend (no backend)
Phase 2 - Fullstack project with admin panel
Phase 3 - Add authentication and protected routes
Phase 4 - Add cart and payments

This is a real project built for a client. The client is a new publisher with only a handful of books and authors.

I am currently working on Phase 1 which I will build with React.
